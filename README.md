# Work Environment Survey

This survey was developed for a fictional web developer company to improve their work environment. The survey is the employers first step in the process of improving the work environment. They will therefore just look at the physical work environment in the office and in the break room and the social environment overall. This is to be able to identify what part they should focus on first when they start working on improving the work environment along with the employees.

In the survey, the employees are asked to give their age, gender, department they work in and then to respond to three questions using a few words on a scale from terrible to great. The questions concern the physical work environment in the office (where they were asked to consider things such as noise levels, heating, ergonomic set up at the desk, etc.), the physical environment in the break room/lunch room (with similar aspects to consider) and the third question concerns the social environment at work (where the employees were asked to think about things like how the team talked to each other, if there were any discriminatory behavior or language, if you feel like you can ask for help etc.).
