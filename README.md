The idea is for an employer to survey how the employees feel abut their work environment. The survey is the employers first step in the process of improving the work environment. They will therefore just look at the physical work environment in the office and in the lunch room and the social environment overall. This is to be able to identify what part they should focus on first when they start working with the work environment along with the employees.

In the survey, the employees were asked to give their age, gender, job title and then to respond to three questions on a scale. The questions concerned the social work environment, the physical work environment in the office (where they were asked to consider such as noise levels, heating, ergonomic at the desk, etc.), the physical environment in the lunch room (with similar aspects to consider) and the third question concerned the social environment at work (where the employees were asked to think about things like how the team talked to each other, if there were any discriminatory behavior or language, if you feel like you can ask for help etc.).
Scale: Terrible - Bad - Needs improvement - Good - Great
