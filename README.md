# Work Environment Survey

This survey was developed for a fictional web developer company to improve their work environment. The survey is the employers first step in the process of improving the work environment. They will therefore just look at the physical work environment in the office and in the break room and the social environment overall. This is to be able to identify what part they should focus on first when they start working on improving the work environment along with the employees.

In the survey, the employees are asked to give their age, gender, department they work in and then to respond to three questions using a few words on a scale from terrible to great. The questions concern the physical work environment in the office (where they were asked to consider things such as noise levels, heating, ergonomic set up at the desk, etc.), the physical environment in the break room/lunch room (with similar aspects to consider) and the third question concerns the social environment at work (where the employees were asked to think about things like how the team talked to each other, if there were any discriminatory behavior or language, if you feel like you can ask for help etc.).

- Welcome to the survey:
   The first thing that comes up as you start running the program is a welcome and an explanation of what the survey is about as well as a message for the user to take their time filling it out.

- Question inputs:
   The second thing that happens is that the user is presented with five questions along with some instructions. The user is prompted to answer the questions as truthfully as possible.

- Password:
   Once the questions are answered, the user is prompted to submit the password needed to review the results. This is a feature to limit the information from the survey to a few selected people in the admin staff. The password is "admin" and any incorrect submits generate a statement telling the user the password is incorrect, to try again or to leave the survey as they are reassured that the topic of the survey will be brought up again later.

- Results:
   As one passes the correct password to the input field, the user is presented with a percentage of the amount of negative answers for six age groups and three gender groups. This can then be used for analysis on correlations between age/gender and negative opinions on the work environment.
   This is also followed by results showing how many
